# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-Cancellation-Prediction

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand 

This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a  
resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was 
made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, 
and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. 

In this project I've performed exploratory data analysis with python 
to get insight from the data.

And built a machine learning model to predict the booking 
cancellation in the hotel.

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand 

This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was 
made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies,and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. 

In this project, I've performed exploratory data analysis with python to get an insight about the reservations made in this hotel from the dataset like:

1. Where do the guests come from?
2. Finding the Home country of Guests by performing Spatial Analysis.
3. How much do guests pay for a room per night?
4. How does the price per night vary over the year?
5. Analysing Preference of Guests, what sort of meal do they basically Prefer?

And built a machine learning model to predict the booking cancellation in the hotel.
